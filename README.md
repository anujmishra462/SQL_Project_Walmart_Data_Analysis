# SQL_Project_Walmart_Data_Analysis
Excited to share my Walmart SQL Project! 🔍📊 I analysed a large retail dataset to find important business insights 💡📈

📌 What I worked on:
• Analyzed Walmart sales data to identify trends, store performance, and customer buying patterns.
• Used advanced SQL techniques — JOINs, subqueries, window functions, and aggregations — to answer real business questions.
• Cleaned and transformed large datasets for accurate analysis and reporting.
• Optimized SQL queries to improve speed, efficiency, and overall performance.

🎯 Outcome:
This project strengthened my skills in SQL-based analytics, retail performance evaluation, and handling real-world datasets. It also improved my confidence in writing optimized, production-ready SQL queries.
